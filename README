_IceCream for Bukkit_

Add flavours to your Bukkit!

*What does it do?*
IceCream is an auto-patcher for Bukkit.
It will give you a list of Bukkit versions to choose from, followed by list of
mods for that version, fetched from any number of sites.
Once you have selected mods, it will download the selected Bukkit jar from
bukkit.org, the mods from the authors' sites, then assemble them into a final,
ready-to-use craftbukkit.jar file.

*Why IceCream?*
Because it fills buckets, and comes in many flavours.
